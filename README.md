## Team Members

## Goals
* Exploratory analysis
  * Find patterns among buildings that violate
* Predict building violations
* Produce a ranking that can be used for prioritization

## Outline of Steps
1. Data dictionary: figure out what's in the data, what features we have
2. Clean the data and merge Violations & Permits together.
3. Descriptive statistics and exploratory analysis
  * Fraction of inspections that result in violations
  * Frequency of inspections
  * Types of inspectors
  * Types of violations
  * Some initial correlations to choose features
4. Create features
5. Model methods
  * Logistic regression?
  * Ranking methods in ML
    * Start with binary classifier
  * Random forests?
  * Think about importance of violations: cost of violation vs cost of inspection 
6. Testing
  * Cross validation: do we need to roll it by hand or is there a canned package?
7. Visualization
